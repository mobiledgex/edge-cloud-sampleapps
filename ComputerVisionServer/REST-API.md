# MobiledgeX Computer Vision Server REST API

This document describes the REST API for the MobiledgeX Computer Vision server.
In general, all requests require an "image" parameter, that includes the image
to be processed. This image can be in either PNG or JPEG format.

The server supports several different `Content-Type` values in the HTTP request.
For each Content-Type, there are different rules for how the "image" data must be included. In all cases, using JPEG is encouraged because of its smaller image size
which results in faster overall processing.

| Content-Type | image data |
| - | - |
| image/png | The request body is made up of raw image bytes in the PNG format. |
| image/jpg | The request body is made up of raw image bytes in the JPEG format. |
| multipart/form-data |  Raw image bytes are included as part of a multi-part form with an input type of "file" and a name of "image", and that part's `Content-Type` must be "image/png" or "image/jpeg". |
| application/x-www-form-urlencoded | The image is Base64-encoded and included as a POST parameter named "image". |

In the `curl` examples included below, the "multipart/form-data" format is used. Different HTTP libraries in different languages may use one of the other Content-Type formats, so we have added support for the most common ones.

## Face Detection
`/detector/detect/`

Used to send a face image to the server and get back a set of coordinates for any detected faces.

### POST
`http://<hostname>:8008/detector/detect/`

#### Parameters
| Parameter | Description |
| - | - |
| image | The face(s) image. |

#### Return
JSON string with the following attributes.

| Attribute | Description |
| - | - |
| success | "True" if face detected, otherwise "false". |
| server_processing_time | The time in milliseconds that it took the server to process this image. |
| rects | A JSON array of coordinates containing the detected faces. Rectangle format is left, top, right, bottom, in relation to the upper-left origin of 0, 0. Only included if "success"="true". |

#### Examples:
##### Single face detected:
```
curl http://facedetection.defaultedge.mobiledgex.net:8008/detector/detect/ -F "image=@Bruce.jpg"
{"success": "true", "server_processing_time": "19.873", "rects": [[73, 76, 147, 150]]}
```

##### Multiple faces detected:
```
curl http://facedetection.defaultedge.mobiledgex.net:8008/detector/detect/ -F "image=@face_triple.jpg"
{"success": "true", "server_processing_time": "30.898", "rects": [[6, 104, 59, 157], [68, 165, 138, 235], [120, 28, 189, 97]]}
```

##### No faces detected:
```
curl http://facedetection.defaultedge.mobiledgex.net:8008/detector/detect/ -F "image=@single_pixel.png"
{"success": "false", "server_processing_time": "0.030"}
```

## Face Recognition
`/recognizer/predict/`

Used to send a face image to the server and get back a set of coordinates for the recognized face, along with a "subject" name value if the face is recognized against the current trained data.

_Note: This call is limited to a single face. At training time, no images are added to the set if more than one face is detected. If more than one face is present in an image for this call, prediction will only be performed on the first face detected._

### POST
```
http://<hostname>:8008/recognizer/predict/
```

#### Parameters
| Parameter | Description |
| - | - |
| image | The face image. |

#### Return
JSON string with a "success" value of "true" or "false", and if successful, the following JSON values:

| Attribute | Description |
| - | - |
| success | "True" if face recognized, otherwise "false". |
| subject | Name of detected face. |
| confidence | Level of confidence. Actually a measure of distance the features are from matching a given subject. Lower is better, with 0 being a perfect match. |
| rect | Coordinates of detected face. |
| server_processing_time | Time in milliseconds that it took the server to process this image. |

_Note: This call will return subject names even with very poor (high distance) confidence values. It is up to the caller to decide what it considers a good prediction. For instance in the [MobiledgeX SDK Demo app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mobiledgex.sdkdemo), the *RECOGNITION_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD* value is 105, which means that any image with a confidence value higher than that will be shown with a subject name of "Unknown"._

#### Examples:
##### Face detected and recognized:
```
curl facedetection.defaultedge.mobiledgex.net:8008/recognizer/predict/ -F "image=@Bruce.jpg"
{"success": "true", "subject": "Bruce Armstrong", "confidence": "71.850", "server_processing_time": "48.218, "rect": [73, 78, 146, 151]}
```

##### Face not detected:
```
curl facedetection.defaultedge.mobiledgex.net:8008/recognizer/predict/ -F "image=@single_pixel.png"
{"success": "false", "server_processing_time": "0.082"}
```
##### Training data update in progress:
```
curl facedetection.defaultedge.mobiledgex.net:8008/recognizer/predict/ -F "image=@Bruce.jpg"
<HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable>
{"success": "false", "error": "Training data update in progress"}
```
If this state is encountered, it should only last a few seconds.

## Pose Detection
`/openpose/detect`

Used to send an image with one or more human bodies to the server and get back a set of coordinates for any detected poses, where a pose is a list of bones for a given human body in the image. In our implementation, pose detection requires a GPU in order to run. If the server executing this call does not have GPU support, a `501 Not Implemented` response will be returned along with the message "OpenPose not supported on this server".

### POST
```
http://<hostname>:8008/openpose/detect/
```

#### Parameters
| Parameter | Description |
| - | - |
| image | The body/bodies image. |

#### Return
JSON string with the following attributes.

| Attribute | Description |
| - | - |
| success | "True" if pose detected, otherwise "false". |
| server_processing_time | The time in milliseconds that it took the server to process this image. |
| poses | A JSON array of coordinates containing the detected poses. Only included if "success"="true". |


#### Examples:

##### No GPU Support:
```
curl -v http://facedetection.defaultedge.mobiledgex.net:8008/openpose/detect/ -F "image=@6_bodies.jpg"
<HTTP/1.1 501 Not Implemented>
OpenPose not supported on this server
```

##### Single body detected:
```
curl http://posedetection.defaultedge.mobiledgex.net:8008/openpose/detect/ -F "image=@HollyGolfPose.jpg"
{"success": "true", "server_processing_time": "35.358", "poses": [[[81.44993591308594,

```

We'll only show a single pose being recognized, as the amount of data returned for multiple poses can be quite large.

#### Response Details
Each value in the "poses" array is an x, y coordinate, followed by a confidence value. If more than one body is detected, multiple arrays of coordinates will be included in the response.

The received points represent the start or end of a “bone”, so they must be rendered as pairs. The “0.0” value means that particular segment was not detected.

##### Rendering Implementation for Android
The following Java arrays are used to render the received coordinates.
```
/**
* The pairs array is a 2D list of the body parts that should be connected together.
* E.g., 1 for "Neck", 2 for "RShoulder", etc.
* See https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/blob/master/doc/output.md
*/
private int[][] pairs = {
       {1,8},{1,2},{1,5},{2,3},{3,4},{5,6},{6,7},{8,9},{9,10},{10,11},{8,12},
       {12,13},{13,14},{1,0},{0,15},{15,17},{0,16},{16,18},{14,19},
       {19,20},{14,21},{11,22},{22,23},{11,24}
};

/**
* Colors array corresponding to the "pairs" array above. For example, the first pair of
* coordinates {1,8} will be drawn with the first color in this array, "#ff0055".
*/
private String[] colors = {
       "#ff0055", "#ff0000", "#ff5500", "#ffaa00", "#ffff00", "#aaff00", "#55ff00", "#00ff00",
       "#ff0000", "#00ff55", "#00ffaa", "#00ffff", "#00aaff", "#0055ff", "#0000ff", "#ff00aa",
       "#aa00ff", "#ff00ff", "#5500ff", "#0000ff", "#0000ff", "#0000ff", "#00ffff", "#00ffff",
       "#00ffff"};
```

## Object Detection
`/object/detect/`

Used to send an image to the server and get back a set of coordinates and names for any detected objects. Unlike Pose Detection, which requires a GPU, object detection can be ran in CPU-only mode, though it will be considerably slower.

### POST
`http://<hostname>:8008/object/detect/`

#### Parameters
| Parameter | Description |
| - | - |
| image | The object(s) image. |

#### Return
JSON string with the following attributes.

| Attribute | Description |
| - | - |
| success | "True" if object(s) detected, otherwise "false". |
| server_processing_time | The time in milliseconds that it took the server to process this image. |
| gpu_support | Whether the server is using a GPU to accelerate image processing. |
| objects | A JSON array which may contain a nested JSON array with the following attributes: |
|  | `rect`: Coordinates of the object. Rectangle format is left, top, right, bottom, in relation to the upper-left origin of 0, 0. |
|  | `class`: Class name of the object, e.g. "ball", "dog", etc. |
|  | `confidence`: Confidence level that the object was identified correctly. This is different than the confidence value for face recognition. Here the range is 0 to 1, with 1 being 100% confidence. |

#### Examples:
##### Single object detected:
```
curl http://posedetection.defaultedge.mobiledgex.net:8008/object/detect/ -F "image=@Bruce.jpg"
{"success": "true", "server_processing_time": "27.182", "gpu_support": true, "objects":
[{"rect": [1, 48, 203, 276], "class": "person", "confidence": "1.00"}]}
```

##### Multiple objects detected:
```
curl http://posedetection.defaultedge.mobiledgex.net:8008/object/detect/ -F "image=@objects_001.jpg"
{"success": "true", "server_processing_time": "28.584", "gpu_support": true, "objects":
[{"rect": [-1, 76, 112, 206], "class": "bicycle", "confidence": "1.00"}, {"rect": [57,
147, 106, 202], "class": "sports ball", "confidence": "0.92"}, {"rect": [92, 64, 165,
170], "class": "chair", "confidence": "0.99"}, {"rect": [137, 55, 179, 87], "class":
"laptop", "confidence": "0.98"}]}
```

##### No objects detected on non-GPU server:
```
curl http://facedetection.defaultedge.mobiledgex.net:8008/object/detect/ -F "image=@single_pixel.png"
{"success": "false", "server_processing_time": "3827.654", "gpu_support": false}
```

# API Server
This is a simple API server that can either be run locally via `docker-compose` or deployed to the Edge using the MobiledgeX console or the `mcctl` utility. 

The `data/db.json` file contains the data to be served by the simple node-based api server. This can be edited to your liking. When this is deployed, the file will grow as data is inserted (the API server alows inserts and updates).

<h2>CSV File Format</h2>
<p>The CSV file uses comma (',') as separator and needs to have the following format:</p>
<table border="1" width="100%">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Time</th>
        <th>Date</th>
        <th>Latitude</th>
        <th>Longitude</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>19:36:23</td>
        <td>7/26/2018</td>
        <td>48.167466</td>
        <td>11.345</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>While Longitude and Latitude have to be of type float (with '.' separator).</p>
<ol>
    <li>The application will send a request to the API for each point to get the information about the network performance.</li>
    <li>The application will connect each consecutive point (to draw the according polyline).</li>
    <li>Each point will receive a score to determine its color.</li>
    <li>The polylines will be drawn.</li>
</ol>
